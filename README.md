## Hello World!

My name is Janise, and I'm a rising senior at Fox Chapel Area High School in Pittsburgh, PA.  

My primary topics of interests include human-computer interaction and cognitive science, and I currently assist Dr. Malihe Alikhani's research at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh.
